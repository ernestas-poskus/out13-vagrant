Hints
-----

**Provisioning**

To provision again in case of update or errors while the virtual machine is already up, use:

```shell
vagrant provision [main, js, db]
```
It just runs puppet to apply manifests without restarting the virtual machine.

**Startup speed**

To speed up the startup process after the first run, use:

```shell
vagrant up --no-provision
```
It just starts the virtual machine without provisioning of the puppet recipes.

Bash Binaries
-----

**To start main Vagrant instance node**

```shell
dev - to start [main, db] environments in parallel
dev js - to start node.js + mongodb environment
```

**To destroy and start again**

```shell
du [main, js, db]
```

**To provision Vagrant instance with puppet**

```shell
pr [main, js, db]
```

**Shortcut to ssh into Vagrant node instances**

```shell
ss [main, js, db]
```

**To bring up several nodes in parallel without provision**


```shell
up [main, js, db]
```
