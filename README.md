Hints
-----

**Provisioning**

To provision again in case of update or errors while the virtual machine is already up, use:

```shell
vagrant provision [mm, mp, py, js, db]
```
It just runs puppet to apply manifests without restarting the virtual machine.

**Startup speed**

To speed up the startup process after the first run, use:

```shell
vagrant up [mm, mp, py, js, db] --no-provision
```
It just starts the virtual machine without provisioning of the puppet recipes.

-----

```shell
v [mm, mp, py, js, db] environments in parallel
